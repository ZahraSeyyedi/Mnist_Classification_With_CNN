# Mnist_Classification_With_CNN
In this project, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used . The model consists of 4 convolutional layers, followed by 2 fully connected layers. ReLU activation function is used for all the layers except the last layer, which uses a softmax function to produce the output probabilities for each class.

The model was trained on the training set for 50 epochs, with a batch size of 128 and a learning rate of 0.001. The training process achieved a parse_categorical_accuracy: 0.9966
